# Cairo Arithmetic Operations

This repository contains a collection of arithmetic functions implemented in the Cairo programming language, known for its use in blockchain and smart contract development. The program demonstrates basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more complex ones like modular arithmetic and power calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Perform modulo operations.
- **Power Function**: Calculate the power of a number.
- **Serialization**: Serialize the output of calculations for blockchain compatibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Cairo-lang (Refer to [Cairo documentation](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/quickstart.html) for installation instructions)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cairo-arithmetic-operations.git
cd cairo-arithmetic-operations
```

### Running the Program

To run the main Cairo program:

```bash
cairo-run --program=main.cairo --print_output
```

## Usage

The repository includes several functions in the `main.cairo` file, which you can call to perform different arithmetic operations. For example, to add two numbers, use the `calculate_sum` function.

Example usage in `main.cairo`:

```cairo
let (sum_result) = calculate_sum(4, 3);
serialize_word(sum_result);
```
